## Workflows

n8n provides powerful workflow automation capabilities. Hereâ€™s how to set up a basic workflow:

1. **Create a New Workflow**: Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. **Add Trigger**: Use an HTTP webhook as the trigger.
3. **Add Email Node**: Configure the email node to send alerts.
4. **Connect Nodes**: Link the trigger to the email node.
5. **Activate Workflow**: Make sure to activate your workflow to start receiving leads.

For detailed instructions on setting up workflows, refer to the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io).

## API Endpoints

The backend provides several API endpoints to interact with the lead generation system:

- **POST /api/leads**: Create a new lead.
- **GET /api/leads**: Retrieve all leads.
- **GET /api/leads/:id**: Retrieve a specific lead by ID.
- **DELETE /api/leads/:id**: Delete a lead by ID.

### Example Usage

To create a new lead, you can use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/leads -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}'
```
